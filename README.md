# 6.0001EECS
This repository is for all the projects, programs, and coursework from MIT's EECS 6.0001
Just for keeping a time stamp on how long it took me to complete this course I started it on the first of April and it should appoximately take 9 weeks if you budget your time out correctly. Please check out MIT's EECS for more details!!
